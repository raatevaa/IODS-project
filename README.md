Introduction to Open Data Science
---------------------------------

This is the **official** README-file of my IODS-project. Rmd-files (Chapter 1-6) contain the exercises completed in this course. Files are updated on weekly basis while course progresses.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Topics of the project:

-   Regression and model validation (CH2)

-   Logistic regression (CH3)

-   Clustering and classification (CH4)

-   Dimensionality reduction techniques (CH5)

-   Analysis of longitudinal data (CH6)

Results can be examined from my course diary page, at [\[Diary\]](https://raatevaa.github.io/IODS-project/)

Had several issues with Rmarkdown-installation:

Knitting HTML did not work: *"Rendering R Markdown documents requires an updated version of the rmarkdown package"*

-   Solved issue by updating R-version from 3.0 to 3.4
